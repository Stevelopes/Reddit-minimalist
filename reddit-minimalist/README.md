This project was built for Codecademy's Full Stack Career

It's a Reddit Client built with React and Redux.

This app gets posts and comments from Reddit's JSON API. The user can browse popular subreddits and filter the content by "hot", "top voted", "rising" and "new". A search feature is also provided to find posts that match a given search term.

A live demo can be found [here](https://redditpocket.netlify.app/).
